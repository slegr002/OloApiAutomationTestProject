## General info
- This Project is to demonstrate how I write automation API test, but I was not able to complete the entire project 
- I was able to write a few positive and negative test for the API
- But, I noticed that the API has some issues where it's returning a Status Code 200 when I enter a bad URL for some of my negative test
- I did not finish setting up all the negative test I wanted to do
- I did not finish organizing the project structure
- I did not finish setup Reporting which I used Extent Report
	
## Technologies
- Visual Studio 2019 IDE
- C# Language
- NUnit as the Test Framework
- ExtentReport for Reporting
- NewtonSoft.Json to Serialize and Deserialize content
- NJson Schema for Json Schema validation
